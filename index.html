                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p class="lead">I'm a web developer with a passion for design, details and functionality. I have been creating things online
                    for over a decade and working in the industry for the past five years. I care about creating great user
                    experiences that work on a wide range of platforms and for people of all abilities.</p>

                    <h2><a href="#">Giants &amp; Gentlemen &rarr;</a></h2>
                    <p>I developed the website for Toronto based advertising agency Giants & Gentlemen to portray their work,
                        showcase their culture, and attract new talent to work with them. The site won a <a href="#">WMA Internet Advertising
                        Competition Award for Outstanding Website</a>.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h2><a href="#">Reds &rarr;</a></h2>
                    <p>I worked with the creative team to bring their elegant design concept to life. The site gives users quick
                        and easy access to menus, events and booking via OpenTable. The client can easily update everything
                        in WordPress.

                    <h2><a href="#">The Cat Inn &rarr;</a></h2>
                    <p>I designed and developed a site to bring a fresh look to South England based restaurant and bed &amp;
                        breakfast The Cat Inn. It gives way to striking photography and conveniently places an easy way to
                        book a table or room, or get in contact.</p>
